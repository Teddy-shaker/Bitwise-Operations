# Bitwise-Operations
This program reads a text document, “packs” the ASCII characters from that document into unsigned int variables, and outputs those variables to another text file as integers in HEXADECIMAL format. This program also reverses the process, converting the unsigned int numbers back into a copy of the original text document
